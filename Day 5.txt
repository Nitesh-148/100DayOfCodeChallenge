# Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
#If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
#If the value of grade is less than 38 , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
